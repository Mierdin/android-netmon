MASSIVE changes made in this release

Added the ability to go into a device's properties and view stuff like MAC address, IP, and status, alongside 
	buttons to allow a remote shutdown, reboot, or wakeup of the system. Wakeup is not enabled in this version, but
	is almost done, so will be included in the next version.

Cleaned up the main list so that the buttons extend to the right

Cleaned up error handling, and logging.

Created a "Device" object for easy manipulation of data within lists.
