The NetworkMonitor solution consists of two components – an Android application, which you may or may not have downloaded, and a distributed component that is installed on the distributed network which you intend to monitor. This component can run on any platform that has Java installed, and is running the Tomcat application server with Axis. There are several applications that run on this system that maintain a database of network-attached devices. This system sits in your network’s DMZ, and brokers sessions between the remote Android application, and the network device(s) being administered.

Currently, this distributed component is not as available as the android application is. This component is being developed to be a one-click install process, so that you can set up the requisite server platform, then run an installer to install all required components. Until that time, this component will not be generally available. Please feel free to email me if you wish to be an early adopter of this component.

I hope this cleared a few things up for you, and got you excited about getting your hands on this software! I’ve had a ton of fun developing it, and running successful tests, and I’m working as quickly as possible to get it into your hands, without compromising on quality.
